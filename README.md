# Snake-n-Ladder-GUI-Game
This is a GUI Based Snake and Ladder game which is created by using the PYGAME Library. This project has been made according to the need of my college project.

Data Structure is an important Topic in Computer Science. I have used the concept of Array or Lists(as called in Python) to develop this project.

Lists has been used to define the starting and ending points of the Ladder and Snake.
